This website describes how we analysed the genetics of adult- and childhood-onset dementia using network propogation and colocalisation to identify drug to reposition for these diseases. 

We first looked at the genetics of adult-onset dementia (AD, PD, ALS, FTLD, DLB) and the childhood dementia subgroups described in [Elvidge et al. Brain](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/146/11/4446/7226999)
